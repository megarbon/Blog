Hey, I'm Melaku García, a Software Engineering student at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. I'm all about exploring the cool stuff in life, from physics and philosophy to psychology and economics.

In the tech world, I'm diving into the mix of computer science and physics. Right now, I'm geeking out on cloud solutions, trying my hand at DevOps, and making sure my code fortress is hacker-proof.

When I'm not coding, you'll catch me breaking a sweat with fitness adventures or chasing that next "aha" moment in personal growth. Life's too short not to embrace the fun, right?

Let's connect! Follow my random thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/srmegabon) and see what I'm up to on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melakugb/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/megarbon).

Excited to share this journey with you!
